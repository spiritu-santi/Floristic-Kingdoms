Files needed to run the results from:

Carta A, Peruzzi L, Ram√≠rez-Barahona S. 2021. A global phylogenetic regionalisation of vascular plants reveals a deep split between Gondwanan and Laurasian biotas (under review)

- The data directory contains the datasets necessary to process the GBIF data (all other files are generated within the script).
- The code directory contains R scripts to process the GBIF data (occurrence records are available at https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.bdxzkw), run the analyses and plot the results (NOTE: the resulting plots were edited in Adobe Illustrator to obtain the final figures).
- The shapefile directory contains the resulting regionalization scheme in SHP format, which can be directly imported into any GIS software.
